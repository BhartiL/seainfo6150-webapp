    <p>The <em>Statue of Liberty's</em> original torch is getting a new home.</p>
<p>Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica in 1984.<span> It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since.</span> </p>
<p>But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new <i>Statue of Liberty Museum</i>, which will open on <i>Liberty Island</i> in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's face.</p>
<p>&quot;Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved,&quot; says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the torch, &quot;it is certainly the most important.&quot;</p>
<p>Not only is the <i>Statue of Liberty</i> the symbol of <i>New York City</i>, she is also a <i>UNESCO</i> World Heritage site under the designation of <em>&quot;Outstanding Universal Value.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Her full name is <em>Liberty Enlightening the World</em>, and she was designed by <i>Frederic Auguste Bartholdi</i> and built by <i>Gustave Eiffel</i> -- yes, the same guy who built <i>Paris's Eiffel Tower</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lady Liberty</i> was a gift from <i>France</i> to the <i>United States</i> to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although, somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, <i>President Grover Cleveland</i> formally unveiled her in 1886.</p>
<p>Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants via neighboring Ellis Island.</p>
<p>&quot;The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy,&quot; says John Piltzecker, superintendent of the <i>Statue of Liberty National Monument</i>. That symbolic spirit was bolstered by the decision to inscribe <i>Emma Lazarus'</i> poem <i>&quot;The New Colossus&quot;</i> on the statue's pedestal, which gave Lady Liberty one of her nicknames, <em>&quot;Mother of Exiles.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The most famous lines in the poem are: <blockquote>&quot;Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.&quot;</blockquote></p>
<p>In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.</p>
<p>When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's symbolism both in the US and around the world.</p>
<p>The <i>&quot;inspiration gallery,&quot;</i> which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at <i>Lower Manhattan</i>, including the <i>World Trade Center</i>.</p>
